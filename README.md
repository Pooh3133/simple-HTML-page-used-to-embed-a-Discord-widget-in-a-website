# simple-HTML-page-used-to-embed-a-Discord-widget-in-a-website
Here is an example of a simple HTML page that can be used to embed a Discord widget in a website

``` <!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<head>

  <title>My Discord Server</title>

</head>

<body>

  <h1>Welcome to My Discord Server</h1>

  <p>Join our community and connect with other members in real-time!</p>

  <iframe src="https://discordapp.com/widget?id=YOUR_SERVER_ID&theme=dark" width="350" height="500" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0"></iframe>

</body>

</html>
```

This code creates a simple HTML page with a heading and a paragraph of text, and embeds a Discord widget in the page using an iframe element. The src attribute of the iframe specifies the URL of the Discord widget, which includes the ID of the Discord server and the desired theme (dark or light). You will need to replace YOUR_SERVER_ID with the ID of your Discord server in order for the widget to work properly.

The Discord widget allows users to see the online status of other members, view channels, and send messages without leaving the website. You can customize the appearance of the widget by adjusting the width, height, and theme parameters in the iframe element.

Keep in mind that this is just an example, and you may need to modify the code to suit your specific needs and requirements. You may also want to add additional elements to your HTML page, such as styles, images, or other content.
